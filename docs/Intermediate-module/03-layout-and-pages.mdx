# Pages and Layouts with Next.js

**Objective**: Develop five static pages for an e-commerce platform, focusing on functionality and structure. For design inspiration, refer to the Vue Storefront Demo site ([Vue Storefront Demo](https://demo.vuestorefront.io/)).

**Task Details**:

- **Home Page**: Create a welcoming main page showcasing products. Focus on developing a header, hero section, and footer. Replicating the entire page from [Vue Storefront Demo](https://demo.vuestorefront.io/) is unnecessary.
- **Categories Page**: Display a list of product categories with example items.
- **Detailed Product Page**: Offer a detailed view of a single product.
- **Cart Page**: Provide a preview of the order, displaying a summary of items added to the cart for review before checkout. For the Cart and Checkout pages, use a distinct layout that includes a different header to streamline the purchasing process.
- **Checkout Page**: Design a checkout flow with a summary and form. This page should also use the alternative layout designed for the Cart Page to ensure a consistent and focused checkout experience.

**Special Considerations**:

- For the Cart and Checkout pages, employ a unique layout that differs from the main site layout to ensure a focused and distraction-free checkout process.
- Use `page.tsx` files for defining individual pages and `layout.tsx` for shared layouts, ensuring each page is thoughtfully integrated into the overall site structure.

**Why Layouts are Important**:
Layouts in Next.js allow for consistent design and structure across multiple pages. They provide a convenient way to share common elements like headers, footers, and navigation bars among different pages, ensuring a cohesive user experience. For example, a shared layout can include a header with navigation links that remain consistent across most pages, enhancing usability and navigation efficiency. However, for specific pages like the Cart and Checkout, a different layout can help minimize distractions and focus the user's attention on completing their purchase.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Populate pages with mock data. The organization of mock content is up to you.
- Utilize Next.js for file-system routing.
- Implement shared and unique layouts as required, particularly for the Cart and Checkout pages.
- Prioritize scalable code over pixel-perfect design.
- Employ components from the Storefront UI React library ([Storefront UI React Documentation](https://docs.storefrontui.io/v2/react/getting-started.html)), noting that not all components may be available. In such cases, focus on creating functional components rather than achieving an exact design match.

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- Effective routing and setup (20%).
- Appropriateness of mock data (20%).
- Successful implementation of layouts, with special attention to the Cart and Checkout pages (20%).
- Functional navigation (15%).
- Judicious use of Storefront UI components, understanding some may need custom development (5%).
