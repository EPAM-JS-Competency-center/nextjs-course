# Getting Started (Styling, fonts, components)

**Objective**: Establish a project infrastructure by creating a fundamental home page made up of components. The project should also include proper configurations for Eslint and Prettier to ensure code consistency, quality, and adherence to stylistic guidelines.

**Task Details**:

- **Create project**: Set up a new project with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app) and TypeScript for static type-checking.
- **Install Storefront UI**: Integrate and configure [Storefront UI](https://docs.storefrontui.io/v2/react/getting-started.html), a customizable ReactJS component library.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Ensure that the new project is set up successfully with TypeScript and Next.js defaults.
- It should be possible to import and correctly render basic Storefront UI components. The project should still be built successfully, with no errors associated with Storefront UI usage.

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- Project structure defined (50%).
- Storefront UI components integrated (50%).
