# Custom Error Pages in Next.js

**Objective**: Implement and customize static 404 and 500 error pages in a Next.js application, ensuring efficient error handling and minimal server load.

**Task Details**:

- **404 Page**: Develop a custom 404 page that is statically generated to minimize server load and improve user experience during page not found errors.
- **500 Page**: Create a custom 500 page for handling server-side errors, generated statically to reduce the complexity of error responses.
- **Advanced Customization**: Learn to manage more complex error handling scenarios using a custom `_error.js` file, allowing for dynamic error message rendering based on the error type (client-side vs. server-side).

**Special Considerations**:

- Understand the default behavior of Next.js in providing static 404 and 500 pages to reduce server load and costs.
- Utilize static generation for custom error pages to maintain efficiency and quick response times.
- For advanced error handling, familiarize yourself with the limitations of the `_error.js` file, such as its reserved pathname and its behavior in production versus development environments.

**Why Custom Error Pages are Important**: Custom error pages enhance the user experience by providing clearer, more helpful information when an error occurs. They also offer a chance to maintain the website's branding even in error situations, potentially guiding users back to the site's main content. Efficient handling of these pages, particularly through static generation, ensures that the server remains unburdened by unnecessary loads, keeping the site responsive and cost-effective.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Create a custom 404 page in `pages/404.js` that is statically generated.
- Develop a custom 500 page in `pages/500.js`, also statically generated.
- Implement an advanced error handling page in `pages/_error.js`, capable of distinguishing between client-side and server-side errors and rendering appropriate messages.
- Ensure that the custom error pages are integrated seamlessly into the overall site design, maintaining a consistent user experience.
