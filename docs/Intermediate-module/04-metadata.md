# Metadata

import EvaluationCriteriaCounter from "@site/src/components/EvaluationCriteriaCounter";

**Objective**: In this chapter, your primary objective will be to effectively use the Metadata API in Next.js to manage and implement the metadata for the five main pages of your online store: Home Page, Categories Page, Detailed Product Page, Cart Page, and Checkout Page. This will involve setting up dynamic and static metadata, understanding its impact on SEO and user experience.

**Task Details**:

- **Implement Metadata API for Home Page, Cart Page, Checkout Page**: Use the Metadata API (**static**) to set up the title, description, and other relevant metadata for the Home Page of your online store.
- **Implement Metadata for Categories Page, Detailed Product Page**: Set up the metadata for the Categories Page and Detailed Product Page. This will include dynamic metadata that changes based on the specific category being viewed.

**Why Metadata are Important**:
Metadata is crucial for enhancing search engine optimization and user experience, as it helps search engines understand page content, improves site navigation, and optimizes social media sharing and accessibility. Additionally, it plays a significant role in tracking and analyzing website performance, making it a vital component in web development.

**Evaluation Criteria**:

<EvaluationCriteriaCounter
criteriaWithCoefficients={[
{ criterion: "Implement static metadata", coefficient: 30 },
{ criterion: "Implement dynamic metadata", coefficient: 70 }
]}
/>

Once all tasks are completed, submit a pull request with the above focus areas for your mentor to review. Guidelines and examples for database setup can be found in the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/setting-up-your-database).
