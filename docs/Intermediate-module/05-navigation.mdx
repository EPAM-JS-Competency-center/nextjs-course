# Navigation with Next.js

**Objective**: Add functional navigation to the five static pages developed previously for an e-commerce platform, using the Vue Storefront Demo site ([Vue Storefront Demo](https://demo.vuestorefront.io/)) as design inspiration.

**Task Details**:

- **Home Page**:

  - Implement clickable products that navigate to their Detailed Product Page.

- **Categories Page**:

  - Ensure each product category and example item includes a functional link to the Detailed Product Page.

- **Detailed Product Page**:

  - Add a button/link to add the product to the cart, directing the user to the Cart Page.

- **Cart Page**:

  - Include functionality to modify item quantities.
  - Implement a "Back to Shopping" link returning to the Home or Categories Page.
  - Add a "Proceed to Checkout" button navigating to the Checkout Page.

- **Checkout Page**:
  - Design a form for shipping and contact information.
  - Provide a summary of the order with a total cost.
  - Insert a "Place Order and Pay" button to simulate the purchase completion.

**Special Considerations**:

- Implement a unique layout for the Cart and Checkout pages that streamlines the purchasing process and minimizes distractions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- All products on the Home and Categories pages must navigate to the correct Detailed Product Page when clicked.
- The Cart icon in the header should always navigate to the Cart Page, reflecting the current state of the user's cart.
- The Checkout Page must present a focused layout for users to complete their purchases without external distractions.
- Header links should be consistent and functional across the site, except for the Cart and Checkout pages.

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- The setup of effective routing and functional links between pages (20%).
- The use of mock data that is organized and appropriate for an e-commerce setting (20%).
- The implementation of shared and unique layouts, with special attention to the distinct experience required on the Cart and Checkout pages (20%).
- The presence of functional navigation that allows users to intuitively move throughout the site (15%).
- The use of Storefront UI components where applicable, with custom development as necessary (5%).
