# Introduction: Getting Started

## Welcome to the First Module: Introduction to Next.js

Hello and congratulations on starting your journey with Next.js! Before you dive into the detailed course material on the external link, here's a quick overview of what to expect and how to make the most of it:

### What You Will Learn:

1. __Starting Your Project__: You'll learn how to set up a new Next.js project. This is the first step in creating any web application using Next.js.
2. __Exploring Pre-Written Code__: Unlike many tutorials where you write every line of code, here you'll see a lot of code already written for you. This is great because it's more like what developers do in real jobs – they often work with existing code.
3. __Understanding the Project Structure__: The tutorial will guide you through the different parts of a Next.js project. You'll learn where to find certain files and what each part of the project does. This is crucial for becoming comfortable with Next.js.
4. __Working with Placeholder Data__: You'll use fake data to help build your application. This is common practice when the real data isn't available yet.
5. __Running Your Project__: Finally, you'll learn how to start your Next.js application and see it running on your own computer.

### Tips for Success:

- __Take Your Time__: Don't rush. Understanding the basics is key to mastering Next.js.
- __Explore and Experiment__: Feel free to explore the project and try changing things to see what happens. It's a great way to learn!
- __Don’t Worry About Memorizing__: It’s okay if you don’t remember everything. The goal is to understand the concepts.
